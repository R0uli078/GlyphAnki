## 🎮 How It Works  

1. **Open the app** and start the deck you want to review.  
2. Use the **volume buttons** to control your review:  
   - ▶️ **Short press Volume** → Show the back of the card  
   - 🔼 **Volume Up** → Mark as correct ✅  
   - 🔽 **Volume Down** → Mark as incorrect ❌  
3. Optionally, **display a custom message** on the Glyph.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

1. 🛠 **Enable the API** in **AnkiDroid** → *Advanced Settings*.  
2. 📖 **Allow GlyphAnki** to read the AnkiDroid database.  
3. ♿ **Grant Accessibility Permissions** so you can navigate with the volume buttons.  
4. 🔊 **For audio support**:  
   - Allow access to AnkiDroid’s `collection.media` folder.  
   - Install AnkiDroid via **F-Droid** or another source that allows folder access.  
5. ⚡ All shortcut buttons are in the **Settings** menu.  
6. Specify the **field names** that match your deck.

## 📝 Notes  

- 💤 First-time Glyph display may be tricky — if it doesn’t work, **lock and delock your screen** or **cycle through your Glyph Toys** to “wake” it up.  
- 💥 AnkiDroid may occasionally crash — if it happens, do the **first card** of your deck in AnkiDroid, then go back to GlyphAnki or switch to another deck.
- 📱 GlyphAnki is designed for the new **Nothing Phone (3)** Matrix Glyph.
- 🔠 The current display size is quite small (3 Sino-Japanese characters fit on the Glyph; beyond that, the text scrolls). I’ll try to add the option to freely increase the font size in future updates.
